I vaguely remember the day we met<br>
You stood out, literally <br>
We did not talk back then<br>
But that's where it all began<br>
I saw you through his eyes<br>
While you saw me through hers<br>
Took a while to break it all<br>
But caught it during the fall.<br>
From sins to kins<br>
It was a constant to and fro<br>
And when we rid the filters<br>
Melody filled our ears.<br>
From mapping our way<br>
Simply to survive that day<br>
We now sit at the ledge<br>
Not waiting to push the edge<br>
I am glad you found me<br>
And i you, in this sea<br>
For i could ask for no one better<br>
To witness this me.<br>
