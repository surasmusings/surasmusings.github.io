Who am I if not the person who listens<br>
to the woes of others<br>
Listening to them spin tales <br>
With versions that get better<br>
Who am I if not the person who listens <br>
As they confide their secrets and fears<br>
Along with opinions I never asked for<br>
That they casually abhor<br>
Who am I if not the person who listens<br>
To them lament through their wailing cries<br>
Filled with resentment and pain<br>
As they condemn themselves again <br>
Who am I if not the person who listens<br>
When the screaming stops<br>
As their defunct soul ceases to weep<br>
They capitulate to their defeat.<br>
Who am I if not the person who listens? <br>
Better yet, who am I if I simply listen?<br>
