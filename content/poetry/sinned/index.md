Forgive me for I have sinned<br>
I get on my knees with my hands<br>
Intertwined holding each other<br>
The surity of this action leaves me appalled<br>
Cause I lack the clarity on what to pray for<br>
Hot tears rolled down my left cheek<br>
As I desperately tried to understand <br>
The constant question of what is it that I seek<br>
Kept running through my mind<br>
And then it dawned on me<br>
It was forgiveness that I sought<br>
For my mistakes and regrets<br>
I need to be repented I thought <br>
But what exactly do I ask redemption for?<br>
Is it for the way I am? Or the way I am not?<br>
Is it for who I've become? Or who I've not?<br>
Forgive me for I have sinned<br>
But what exactly have I done wrong?<br>
