We attach meaning to the most random thing<br>
Do you ever wonder why?<br>
We see it and suddenly think<br>
Oh, that's me, that's so me!<br>
I look at my curls as I glide past random mirrors<br>
No gel or mousse holding my ends<br>
Just my hair flying, frizzy and wild<br>
Wait!That's me!<br>
 Wild and free or just untamed <br>
Just embracing the wind as it blows<br>
Letting it shape me however it sees fit<br>
And i wonder ,why crunch and coil<br>
If it's going to break out of the cast anyways?<br>
Might as well let it breathe.<br>
