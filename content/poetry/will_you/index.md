Will you think of me when you see the cows in an alley?<br>
Or will you think of me when you stand atop the bridge with trains moving beneath you?<br>
Will you think of me when you hear the crunch of the chaat we used to share?<br>
Or will you think of me when you have more than enought chocolate to spare?<br>
Will you think of me when it rains at 3 pm in the afternoon in September?<br>
Or will you think of me when you sit in the metro with tears that won't stop?<br>
Will you think of me when you finally finish coding yourself into your laptop?<br>
Or will you think of me when you look at the stickers filled with binary codes that speak only to you?<br>
Will you think of me when you laugh?<br>
Or Will you think of me when you cry?<br>
But<br>
The scariest question of all...<br>
Will you think of me fondly? Or will you think of me.....<br>
