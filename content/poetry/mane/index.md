One day we're here and suddenly we're not<br>
A fragile piece of glass on which we tread upon<br>
The constant what ifs makes the living rot<br>
What's it all for, for in the end we're all gone<br>
Very few try to find beauty in the mundane<br>
For so many only feel desolate and bleak<br>
But we all desperately try to wear a Mane<br>
For living is not for the weak...<br>
