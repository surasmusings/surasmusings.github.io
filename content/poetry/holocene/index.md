I loved him once like I did no other,<br>
With so much passion that it made me wither.<br>
It was him whom I would coddle and smother <br>
In a world of our own away from all the  bother.<br>
What more could I ask for, with him defending my honour <br>
While I sat there relishing his care and candour.<br>

I lose myself everytime his eyes meet mine<br>
Lost in thought that aren't so divine<br>
And somehow figured out where to be<br>
 Cause always by his side was only me.<br>
And there I stayed until the final blow<br>
Only, it came so soon that we were left bereft of life so slow.<br>

I smile softly when I think of him and wipe away my tears when I remember<br>
He would love no other but me, only me<br>
For I was the warmth that thawed his frozen sea<br>
Imbuing a part of me in him and that's where I'll be<br>
And remain forever his Holocene..<br>
