Do you Remember when they told you,<br>
To be quiet and speak when spoken to<br>
Stand straight but never tall,<br>
Cause you don't have to know it all<br>

Remember when you were told,<br>
How not to heal but always hold<br>
Cause you are what you say and do,<br>
But never what to you hope<br>

Remember when you asked,<br>
Oh what is right and wrong<br>
Asked to blindly accept the walls,<br>
Never question what it's for<br>

Remember when you heard, <br>
Those silent whisperers <br>
Who always spoke about thou,<br>
But never once to you<br>

Remember when you carried,<br>
Those voices and their words<br>
Always talking in morse,<br>
For better or for worse<br>

Remember when you never,<br>
Trusted yourself to feel<br>
Or create or heal,<br>
Because you could never be<br>

Remember it all, for that's all you got<br>
No one can help you,<br>
Not a human not god.<br>
