I\u0026rsquo;ve always found something unique in noticing things that hide in plain sight. The victorious joy I feel when I unravel that mystery is unparalleled to any gay apparels I\u0026rsquo;ve felt so far. That\u0026rsquo;s the joy and peace I feel now when I look back, a melancholic calm after a beautiful yet chaotic storm.\nI did things that I have never done before like moving out of home, learning to cook, write more, capture things while living in the moment and many more. But the most precious takeaway from this year was finally figuring out the mystery of letting go with grace. Letting go of things or people has never been problematic for me because I always thought I had things figured out as to what was best for me. However, my three years journey in college was nothing less of a beautiful movie that taught me otherwise. I knew absolutely nothing and that was the best awakening i could ever ask for. The people and experiences that pushed me in this direction of thinking are no longer part of my life but the relationships that I cultivated during this time has stood through the tides. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard my mother say that not everyone will walk with you throughout your life and that\u0026rsquo;s fine because you get to spend the little time you have with them in a more meaningful way. I laughed at her when she first told me that and said that all my friends will be by my side until we face death. Boy was I wrong. Ofcourse I do have a lot of cherished friendships that have lasted till date but there\u0026rsquo;s a long path to death and there are bound to be some twists and turns.\nAnyways, I felt the meaning behind those words this year when I realised that some people are simply meant to be play a role in your life and you in theirs. I started of the year with strength, resilience and determination to be a better person than who I was before. I wanted to figure out if everything people told me about me, be it positive or negative, was true or not. And somehow, god or universe or whatever mysterious being aka my consciousness, decided to throw a win my way and help me figure things out. I realised how burdened I was about things around me, stories of my loved ones, my childhood, films that made me cry, being empathetic, and so much more. I was burdened with things that happened way back in the days and thought I had let it go. I did, to an extent. Even then, the smithereens from the blast left a little soot in my lungs making it hard to breathe, even in a place of clean air.\nI began writing about it all and slowly unfurled the knots softly releasing each thread to its own resting space. I spoke with those who i could to move forward with the conflict and come at an agreement. But there were some with whom no reconciliation was possible. Over the years there had been fights, arguments and even violent outbursts followed with care, affection and loving promises yet no one could help but wish us apart. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think much when I decided to embrace the quote from favourite song as a kid at the beginning of this year but that has been my driving mantra unconsciously. \u0026ldquo;Que sera sera, whatever will be will be\u0026rdquo;. Simple words but I cannot explain the emotions I feel when I repeat it to myself right now.\nCutting people of from my life who serve no purpose but suck the energy out of me has been easy to do because the world was extremely black and white to see. But let go of the things or people you love is never easy since it\u0026rsquo;s a constant battle between the mind and the heart. My friend and I never agreed with Robert Frost \u0026rsquo;s the road not taken analogy. The ultimatum it offered made no sense. Why can\u0026rsquo;t we just go through both the roads at different times? I did it. I made a choice. And I let go of the things that made me who i am today in search of something better. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if what I see will be in the same spectrum as what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen to compare, but I have learnt that there\u0026rsquo;s nothing else to do except let myself be. I started of the year with so much gusto that I have decided to finish my year with a lot of rest and rejuvenation to embrace the next chapter of my life.\n","date":"25 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pensives/the-mystery-of-letting-go/","section":"Pensives","summary":"","title":"The Mystery of Letting Go","type":"pensives"},{"content":" Silence fills our souls\nWhile we Wait for each other at opposite poles,\nNo matter how hard we try\nWe seem to feel awry.\nThe push and pull eventually nipped\nThe beautiful gordian knot, lay there ripped.\nWhile we stood there still, life moved on\nUs along with it but the yearning never stopped.\nThe shift in air was noticeable as we saw things anew\nFor we never knew that all that the cords needed was to be sewed.\nAnd so we sat alone yet somehow together\nBeyond space,time and reality we began to hear.\nThrough the darkest twists and turns\nWithin the labyrinthine, you saw\nEven so the war between mind and heart never seems to die\nJust like the eternal paradox that is, you and i\nWith every battle lost with unwavering consistency\nI stood there awaiting the final blow that is the Coup de Grace.\n","date":"22 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/poetry/coup-de-grace/","section":"Poetry","summary":"","title":"Coup de Grace","type":"poetry"},{"content":" Ever so beckoning like love\nIt lingers with every touch\nEven when you stay away\nIt pulls you with so much trust.\nYou know how it feels\nYou know how it thinks\nIt makes you feel safe\nOr so it seems.\nThe longer you stay afloat\nThe more you tend to know\nIt gets more difficult to drown\nEspecially when you remember the calming sound.\nThe waves crash inside your lungs\nAnd you slowly cease to breathe\nOh the peace you feel\nIs definitely hard to resist.\nAnd just like that the burden renews\nTempting you to dip your toes\nWhat feels warm at first\nIs simply freezing cold.\nMaybe I will take the plunge\nMaybe I\u0026rsquo;ll learn to swim\nBut will I just lie there afloat\nSomething I\u0026rsquo;ll never know.\n","date":"10 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/poetry/afloat/","section":"Poetry","summary":"","title":"Afloat ?","type":"poetry"},{"content":" The haze has a mind of its own\nAlways trying to cover what I had sown\nNever let me see or hone\nAlways felt like I was being borne\nNot once did it stop, the horn\nThe constant wailing was born\nFrom the sound to my eyes I could\u0026rsquo;ve sworn\nLow fidelity was all that shone.\nThe haze is a life of despair\nOnly one that you can never repair\nWith twisted thoughts to spare\nAnd loved ones hearts to tear\nThe least i could do was stare\nAnd watch as my haze declare\nThat I was and will only ever be bare.\n","date":"21 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/poetry/the-haze/","section":"Poetry","summary":"","title":"The Haze","type":"poetry"},{"content":" Empty promises\nBroken ties\nEverything she misses\nWell here it lies.\nThirteen feet under the ground Safe and sound\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where she was found\nTethered and bound.\nEverything meaningless Begging to be blessed No more no less\nJust remained a fractured mess.\nNails hammered down\nThe coffin so brown\nIn the tainted white gown\nBloomed a new dark dawn.\n","date":"8 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/poetry/dawn/","section":"Poetry","summary":"","title":"Dawn","type":"poetry"},{"content":" Recently i have been told that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo; in and around me. When I say recently I mean a few years, the few years of my short life that I remember. I was ten when I first heard the word \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo;. I was asked to sing more boldly from my stomach and not from my throat. I tried. The next day I was asked to dance with more power so that the collision between my feet and the floor resonates amongst the audience who come to see my performance. I tried. The next day my teacher at school handed me my report card for the year and made a remark stating, \u0026quot; i expect more from you next time\u0026quot;. So, I tried yet again next year but unfortunately I got the same remark. Year after year the phrases changed, the people who said it changed but the word \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo; remained constant. At one point in my adolescence I grew fond of the word.\nThat might be a weird thing to say. To grow fond of a word, especially a word like more that is usually used in the context where I am demanded for something, well\u0026hellip;.more! But yes, the word grew on me. I found it complimentary when people used the word more and associated it with me. Almost always, someone or the other hand more expectations for me than I did for myself. I never understood that but I let it happen. I let it get through to me and i strived to be what people thought I was capable of doing, competent and able. Things hit a curve when the word more became something similar yet completely different. The adult version of more walked into my life introducing itself as \u0026ldquo;too much\u0026rdquo;.\nI was exposed to a new season in the series of my life where suddenly they didn\u0026rsquo;t more from me but less of me. I was baffled initially and later reacted like how I would react to another ball thrown to my face, I laughed. I honestly found it amusing. These select few individuals spent years trying to groom me into this spectacular vision that they had in mind and then suddenly those same people along with a few new ones I picked up along the way decided to pick apart the \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo; vision and bring in something new. I try not to sound selfish but, excuse me, where is my say in it all?\nI sat there and watched the new set of \u0026quot; too much\u0026quot; vision unfold trying to pave way for the perfect ensemble of my personality. Things that were appreciated by \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo; was scorned upon by \u0026ldquo;too much\u0026rdquo;, especially my way of thinking and the precedence of feelings. I think too much a certain way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t really let me be a better person that I am capable of being so I tried to feel better. But I feel too much that it invariably hinders my thinking leaving me in a loop to which there\u0026rsquo;s no end. I was told I wanted to much out of life and that I felt too much. Is it too much?\nI thought we only live once and that this life on earth at this point of time is ours, mine! I have access to so many things and what\u0026rsquo;s wrong in wanting to see most if not all? Is that greedy? Is that needy? Is that right? Is that wrong? Is it unrealistic? Is it optimistic? Is it lack of control? Or is it simply unrealistic? I have absolutely no clue. A dear friend of mine always strived to seek the answer that we all yearn for invariably whether we know it or not, the absolute truth. He believes that the path to this destination is lonely and can make a person lose his or her mind in the process. Tempting. It is a noble attempt but do we demand more from him or is it too much to be asked to be left alone?\n","date":"9 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pensives/art_of_more/","section":"Pensives","summary":"","title":"The Art Of More","type":"pensives"},{"content":" Do you Remember when they told you,\nTo be quiet and speak when spoken to\nStand straight but never tall,\nCause you don\u0026rsquo;t have to know it all\nRemember when you were told,\nHow not to heal but always hold\nCause you are what you say and do,\nBut never what to you hope\nRemember when you asked,\nOh what is right and wrong\nAsked to blindly accept the walls,\nNever question what it\u0026rsquo;s for\nRemember when you heard, Those silent whisperers Who always spoke about thou,\nBut never once to you\nRemember when you carried,\nThose voices and their words\nAlways talking in morse,\nFor better or for worse\nRemember when you never,\nTrusted yourself to feel\nOr create or heal,\nBecause you could never be\nRemember it all, for that\u0026rsquo;s all you got\nNo one can help you,\nNot a human not god.\n","date":"7 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/poetry/remember/","section":"Poetry","summary":"","title":"Remember","type":"poetry"},{"content":" I never considered myself to be an artist of any sort. Even if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a jack of all trades I was indeed a jack of multiple trades. I was never really a feminine person, rather i was quite a powerful dancer. I was not an elegant singer but a bold one. But my art on paper, be it words or lines that come out of my pencil was never really impactful for me. It always felt powerless and docile, like I had something to hide or scared to show. Dance and music was always intertwined within me. Anybody who looks at me would know how I start moving when I hear random beats or how I find music in the most random things around me. The weird synchronisation of the uncle on a cycle pedalling on the streets, or the crows deciding to be my orchestra for the day, I have always found things to be artistic without effort.\nAppreciation for art came easily to me. I was always open to trying new music, different films, various genres and unique artists. Unique. It was during one such endeavour to find a new artist that I started questioning the meaning of being unique. This simple word travels around in so many masks like authentic, distinctive, special and much more all revolving around one\u0026rsquo;s self. Be it their skills or their personality, everyone wanted to be stand out from the herd of laymen. I ,too, was one of the many who desperately tried to be someone special in an attempt to steer clear of the traditional route of life. I thought learning a certain discipline would set me apart but it brought me closer to like minded people. I was not ecstatic about this. I felt extremely disappointed that my thoughts and actions were no longer unique. My interest in art was parallely present but slumbering while I was under the pressure to be unique. Why was I under such a pressure? I still can\u0026rsquo;t answer that with conviction but I have a few guesses.\nI had completely given up learning the art of dance but continued to pursue music. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t picked up a pencil to sketch in years but somehow found myself writing words that my trusted confidants labelled as poetry. I found it disturbing to think that I could exist with just music and not dance in my life. To me it has always been intertwined. I tried picking myself up to dance and failed. I tried again and failed. I tried again and failed again. I look around me and see artists everywhere. Especially in the digital era with content creation taking the front seat. It used to be overwhelming and now\u0026hellip; it is absolutely redundant. Music has lost its magic, films are no longer depicting good cinema, and dance has become a little too commercialized for my liking. Everything felt forced and calculated. Art was flow to me. It was like water constant, curving, carving a path for itself and moving forward while adapting.\nNow, I think I\u0026rsquo;ve lost too much by forcing myself to be unique. I felt authentic when I sat against the ledge of my balcony, high off the ground, contemplating caste, politics and death with the moon hanging over me, guiding me. I wrote poems about things I had seen, or hope to see or feel. I felt original when I listened to artists cry melodiously over their broken hearts or how their mind felt alive when connecting with a person whom they can call theirs. Art felt original when there was no pressure to stand out or be unique. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I am a unique person but I\u0026rsquo;m going to try not be one, cause I tried being on the other side and it didn\u0026rsquo;t really work out well.\n","date":"1 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pensives/the_unoriginal_need_to_be_unique/","section":"Pensives","summary":"","title":"The Unoriginal Need to be Unique","type":"pensives"},{"content":" I vaguely remember the day we met\nYou stood out, literally We did not talk back then\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s where it all began\nI saw you through his eyes\nWhile you saw me through hers\nTook a while to break it all\nBut caught it during the fall.\nFrom sins to kins\nIt was a constant to and fro\nAnd when we rid the filters\nMelody filled our ears.\nFrom mapping our way\nSimply to survive that day\nWe now sit at the ledge\nNot waiting to push the edge\nI am glad you found me\nAnd i you, in this sea\nFor i could ask for no one better\nTo witness this me.\n","date":"24 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/poetry/the_beginning/","section":"Poetry","summary":"","title":"The Beginning","type":"poetry"},{"content":" I apologise to start off on a negative note but this is what bothered me enough to pick myself up and write. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t the countless thoughts about existentialism that run through my head, not the patriarchal and misogynistic acts that I witness everyday and certainly not how I relate the mundane things in my life to myself and my muses. No. It was this version of myself that pushed me to question. What has been happening to me? For as long as I can remember, I have been taught to be so many things, an obedient daughter, a supportive friend, a quiet student and a good person. I did not know how to fill out these roles and still find time to figure out who i was without these roles attached to me. I found it baffling when people told me they understood me or that they \u0026ldquo;know\u0026rdquo; me when I was here standing in front of the mirror pushing my cheeks up , pulling my tummy in trying to see what version I can mould myself to be.\nI have never had a slightest clue as to who I am or was without attributing it to a role I was playing. But today, I look back on my recent timeline of events and feel confused. I feel ashamed of the roles I played, not because I did not carry it out well but because i never questioned it. The same people who played a role in shaping my character proceeded to pick and prod making too many holes to mend. I sit with those holes questioning myself and those around me, asking where I went wrong for i do not know. I used the half baked answers they gave me to fill the holes and i proceeded to carry out the role hoping it would make things better. But when I looked at the mirror again, the thing that looked back at me did not resemble what I had perceived myself to be. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think much about myself but I certainly knew i wasn\u0026rsquo;t that thing that I saw. But how could I be so sure? I never really knew myself now did i?\nAs time went by, those answers that held me together fell apart. Eventually the mould withered away. I felt cold and naked sitting by myself with no mould to shackle me, or protect me. I wondered who i was without something encapsulating me for the better or for worse. I felt an intense surge of fear passing through my body as I thought, Am I always going to be known just by the role I played? It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to be alone when you were never left alone to begin with. Solitude doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee enlightenment, it might as well lead to madness. Once again I find myself at a crossroad wondering which way I must go. Just like that the fig tree appeared in front of me and I am afraid I\u0026rsquo;ll be stuck under the cool shade of the beautiful tree filled with so many fruits not knowing which to eat. I can imagine myself under the tree, back against the bark, watching the leaves turn from green to yellow, snow turning to rain and my skeleton would be all that remains. The only thing I ever wished was to be witnessed , not seen, unapologetically, truthfully, nakedly. But it seems like that only the choices that I made or never did, would witness my miserable existence\u0026hellip;\n","date":"20 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pensives/choices/","section":"Pensives","summary":"","title":"Choices","type":"pensives"},{"content":" Staring at the screen Hoping it would turn green\nYour name flashing in front of me\nMy hands hover hesitantly I pushed it first,\nI pushed the button to hear you\nAnd here I am praying you don\u0026rsquo;t answer.\nSame words.
